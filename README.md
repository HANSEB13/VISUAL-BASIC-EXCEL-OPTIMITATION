Optimitation for tables excels  

In this project I made an excel to optimize the order processing of a publishing printing services company, what it does is eliminate tables that were not needed, specific sizes are assigned, the contents are translated as "type of paper" "type of encaratulado" "type of laminated" and more, if the number of books was greater than 10, it is painted in another color and the sum and conversion is done to know how much paper was needed for the number of books that are requested, leaving it on a table apart.
